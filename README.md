Some steps to follow before you implement this project.
-> This is a simple file downloading and file sharing application.
-> Technologies used are NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB Atlas, HTML, CSS, insomnia and sendinblue.
-> Yarn is a package manager for Node. js that focuses on speed, security, and consistency.
-> npm and yarn are almost same, but yarn is more secure than npm
-> npm install -g yarn : to install the yarn through npm.
-> To intitiliaze the project use : yarn init -y. It will initialize the development of a package.
-> To install express use : yarn add express.
-> Nodemon is a popular tool that is used for the development of applications based on nodejs. 
   It simply restarts the node application,whenever it observes the changes in the file,
   present in the working directory of your project.
-> To install nodemon : use yarn add nodemon -D
-> I have used : yarn run dev to run the server.js using nodemon.
-> In this project I have used cloud based database which is mongodb atlas.
-> Mongoose is a Node. js-based Object Data Modeling library for MongoDB.
-> To install mongoose use : yarn add mongoose.
-> dotenv allows you to separate secrets from your source code. 
   This is useful in a collaborative environment.
   where you may not want to share your database login credentials with other people.
   Instead, you can share the source code while allowing other people to create their own .env file
-> To install dotenv use : yarn add dotenv
-> Insomnia is a REST client that makes it easy to send HTTP requests to an API and view response details.
-> Multer is a nodejs middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files.
-> use yarn add multer
-> EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templating) is one of the most popular template engines for JavaScript. 
   If you want to render a static page then go for an HTML file and 
   if you want to render a dynamic page where your data coming from various sources
   then you must choose an EJS file.
-> use yarn add ejs
-> use yarn add mongodb
-> UUIDs are typically used as unique identifiers. You can also use them in JavaScript and Nodejs.
-> use yarn add uuid
-> Nodemailer is a module for Nodejs applications to allow easy email sending.
-> yarn add nodemailer, provide email serives
-> I am using sendinblue for sending mails and can not send emails due to account activation failed.
